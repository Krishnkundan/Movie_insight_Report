# Movie Insight Report

A lightweight project that analyzes movie data to generate insights and visualizations about trends, ratings, genres, and more. This repository contains the analysis notebooks, scripts, and assets used to produce the Movie Insight Report.

## Features
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of movie datasets
- Visualizations for ratings, revenue, genre trends, and release-year distributions
- Summary tables and key metrics
- Exportable figures and report-ready assets

## Dataset
Describe the dataset(s) used in this project here. If you're using a public dataset (e.g., Kaggle, TMDb, IMDB), list the source and any preprocessing steps.

Example:
- Source: Kaggle "movies-recommendation" (replace with the actual source used)
- Preprocessing: cleaned missing values, normalized release dates, parsed genres into lists

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krishnkundan/Movie_insight_Report.git
cd Movie_insight_Report
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt`, create one with your project's dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter).

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis.
- Run analysis scripts in the `scripts/` directory to reproduce specific charts or tables.
- Output/figures are saved to the `outputs/` or `figures/` directory (create if missing).

Example to run a script:

```bash
python scripts/generate_charts.py
```
